Dimensions & Dungeoneering is a modpack built around the RPG and Adventure style. With plenty of Dimensions and Dungeons to explore there is never a shortage of things to do! However, that doesn't mean that people who like tech, magic, building, or other things won't like this pack. When building it I have tried to include something for everyone. So while it is certainly encouraged to explore the dimensions, it isn't necessary. If you want to build magnificent modded structures, there are certainly mods for that! If you want to delve into magic, explore Ars Nouveau, Pedestals, Eidolon, or Occultism! Just want to build technologic marvels? There are mods for you as well!

Overall I have tried to create a pack that everyone will enjoy and have included some quests to help you with that! I'm going to be adding more quests as time progresses too so be on the lookout!
